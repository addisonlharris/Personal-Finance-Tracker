# Personal-Finance-Tracker
 Personal Finance Tracker Designed To Track Monthly Spending Habits
 
To start off this project I created some sample data to generate financial data based on the average 25 year old's monthly spending: based off monthly essentials, utitlies and personals.
The generation data was created under the spending generator folder.
After generating the data it was exported to a csv file under the spending data folder.

That data was then analyzed under the spending analysis folder which was used to create our monthly spending plots.

Below is the analysis of our monthly spend over a three month period
